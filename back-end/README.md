    desc: "Whiteferrari is a beer that has been a long time in the making. We've been experimenting with different malt and hop combinations through other recipes, trying to find what we believe is the best of both worlds rolled into one DIPA. Clocking in at 8%, this luxuriously soft DIPA is hopped intensely with 50/50 Citra and Galaxy(and a ton of it!). We used the freshest crop available of each hop to give this DIPA the most expressive hop character possible. We truly believe this is one of, if not the best hoppy beer we've released(and we hope you agree!).",
